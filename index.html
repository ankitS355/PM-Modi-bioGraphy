                        Narendra Damodardas Modi (born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician who has served as
                        the prime minister of India since 2014. markModi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to
                        2014
                        and is the member of parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party
                        (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a far-right Hindu nationalist paramilitary
                        volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister outside the Indian National
                        Congress.
                        Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary
                        education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. At the age of 18, he was married to
                        Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades
                        later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in
                        1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he rose through the party hierarchy, becoming
                        general secretary in 1998. In 2001, Modi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat and elected
                        to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002
                        Gujarat riots, and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. According to
                        official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim;
                        independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim. A Special Investigation Team
                        appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution
                        proceedings against him. While his policies as chief minister were credited for encouraging
                        economic growth, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health,
                        poverty and education indices in the state.

                        Narendra Modi was born Narendrabhai Damodardas Modi on 17 September 1950. He uses Damodardas as
                        his middle name—Gujaratis have a tradition of using the names of their fathers as their middle
                        names—but he is widely known as Narendra Modi.

                        Sources stating that the RSS had a deep impact on the political hierarchy of the BJP, especially
                        in the case of Narendra Modi:

                        Sources describing Modi's administration as complicit in the 2002 violence:

                    <li>
                        In 2012, a court stated that investigations had found no evidence against Modi.

                        Applications were filed with the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) under the RTI Act seeking details
                        of his arrest. In reply, the PMO said it maintains official records on Modi only since he became
                        the prime minister in 2014. Despite this claim, the official website of the PMO contains
                        information about Modi from the 1950s.

                        Replying to an RTI query, the School of Open Learning said it did not have any data of students
                        who received a BA degree in 1978. Jayantibhai Patel, a former political science professor of
                        Gujarat University, said the subjects listed in Modi's MA degree were not offered by the
                        university when Modi was studying there. In 2016, Delhi University deemed the BA degree
                        to be authentic.

                        The exact number of people killed in the train burning is variously reported. For example, the
                        BBC says it was 59, while The Guardian put the figure at 60.
